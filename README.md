# My Portfolio with React JS using Styled-Components and framer-motion....

I have recently updated all the required dependencies for React Portfolio Website.
You might see some differences in implementation such as,

- In implementing react-router

- I have removed react-particles-js since it has been deprecated and used react-tsparticles instead, you can see it's implementation in ParticlesComponent.js file.

- In the index.js file we are no longer using ReactDOM since we can use createRoot in React 18.
